# Installation
If you have Anaconda, you can install LogDate with conda install

``` bash
   conda install -c uym2 logdate 
```  

Alternatively, you can either clone the repository to your machine 
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uym2/LogDate.git
```
or simply download the zip file to your machine. To install, go to the LogDate folder and type

``` bash
  python setup.py develop
```

# Usage
LogDate accepts calibration points (hard constraint on divergence time) for internal nodes, sampling times at leaf nodes, and a mixture of the two. Here we give examples for the three most common use-cases:

## Use case 1: Infer the unit ultrametric tree
If there is no calibrations given, LogDate will infer the unit (depth 1) ultrametric tree from an input tree.

``` bash
   launch_LogDate.py -i <INPUT_TREE> -o <OUTPUT_TREE>
```

We give an example in folder [examples/unit_time_tree](examples/unit_time_tree), inside which you can find the sampled input tree `phylogram.nwk` and the sampled output tree `chronogram_unit.nwk`.

```bash
   cd examples/unit_time_tree
   launch_LogDate -i phylogram.nwk -o wLogDate.nwk -s 1105
```

Here we use `-s` to specify a random seed. With the correct random seed given, the output file `wLogDate.nwk` should be an exact replicate of `chronogram_unit.nwk`.

## Use case 2: Infer the time tree from phylodynamics data
A typical use-case in virus phylogeny is to infer the time tree from a phylogram inferred from sequences and their sampling times (i.e. calibration points given at leaf nodes). LogDate reads the calibration points / sampling times from an input file via the `-t` option.

```bash
   launch_LogDate -i <INPUT_TREE> -o <OUTPUT_TREE> -t <SAMPLING_TIMES>
```

### 2.1. Complete sampling times
An example is given in the folder `examples/virus_all_samplingTime`, inside which you will find the sampled input tree (`phylogram.nwk`), sampled file to specify the sampling times (`sampling_time.txt`), and the sampled output tree of LogDate (`chronogram.nwk`). In this example, we give LogDate all the sampling times for all leaves (i.e. complete sampling times). The file `sampling_time.txt` has two columns, which are simply the species names and their corresponding sampling times.

```bash
   cd examples/virus_all_samplingTime
   launch_LogDate -i phylogram.nwk -o wLogDate.nwk -t sampling.time.txt -s 1105
```

Again, `-s` is used to specify the random seed. Your output (`wLogDate.nwk`) should be an exact replicate of `chronogram.nwk`.

### 2.2. Partial (missing) sampling times
LogDate allows missing sampling times for a subset of the leaves, as long as there exists at least one pair of leaves with different sampling times. The usage of LogDate for is the same as in the case of complete sampling times. An example is given in the folder `example/viruse_some_samplingTime`. Here we specify the sampling times for only 52 species out of 110 total.

```bash
   cd examples/virus_some_samplingTime
   launch_LogDate -i phylogram.nwk -o wLogDate.nwk -t sampling.time.txt -s 1105
```

### 2.3. Sampling times at internal nodes
LogDate allows the sampling times to be given both internal nodes and at leaves. An example is given in the folder `example/virus_internal_smplTime`. In the example tree, we have all of the nodes (including leaf nodes and internal nodes) has a unique label. If the tree has unique labeling, LogDate allows the calibrations to be specified by their labels. See `example/virus_internal_smplTime/sampling_time.txt`) for an example. 

```bash
   cd examples/virus_internal_smplTime
   launch_LogDate -i phylogram.nwk -o wLogDate.nwk -t sampling.time.txt -s 1105 -k
```
The `-k` flag (or `--keep`) is used to announce LogDate that the tree has already had unique labeling and suppress the auto-label of LogDate.


## Use case 3: Infer the time tree with calibration points given in backward time
For calibration points obtained from fossils, the times are usually referred to as backward time such as "million years ago", or "mya". For your convenience, LogDate allows specification backward time via the `-b` flag.

```bash
   launch_LogDate -i <INPUT_TREE> -o <OUTPUT_TREE> -t <CALIBRATIONS> -b
```
Calibration points can be given in the same way as sampling times. If the tree nodes are uniquely labeled, we can use the labels to identify the internal nodes associated with the calibration points. Alternatively, LogDate allows the identification of a node as the LCA of a set of species and allows optional label assignment to these calibration points. See `examples/fossil_backward_time/calibrations.txt` for an example. See the next section for more details about our conventions on the calibrations.

```bash
   cd examples/fossil_backward_time
   launch_LogDate.py -i phylogram.nwk -t calibrations.txt -o wLogDate.nwk -b -s 1105
```
