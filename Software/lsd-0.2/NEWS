Something new in version 0.2:
- Estimating relative dates in the case that all leaves are sampled at the same time. 
- Rooting method that uses constrained mode on all branches. Hence, now the rooting option -r has 3 possible methods: -r l for re-estimating the root around the given root, -r a for searching the root on all branches using fast method, and -r as for searching the root using constrained mode on all branches (so slow method).
